# TIPS

* Do all the instructions perfectly! Any difference from yours and the expected output? Don't risk it and just ask!
* Do your assignments far from the deadline! Time is precious, and your grade too!
* Do all the POP-QUIZ and weekly QUIZ too! Any bit of extra grade is helpful! Plus, if you're good enough, you can just ignore the last few weeks!
* REMEMBER YOU ARE NOT "cbkadal"!
